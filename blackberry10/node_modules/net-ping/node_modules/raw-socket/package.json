A suitable build chain\n    # must be configured before installation.\n    \n    npm install raw-socket\n\nIt is loaded using the `require()` function:\n\n    var raw = require (\"raw-socket\");\n\nRaw sockets can then be created, and data sent using [Node.js][nodejs]\n`Buffer` objects:\n\n    var socket = raw.createSocket ({protocol: raw.Protocol.None});\n\n    socket.on (\"message\", function (buffer, source) {\n        console.log (\"received \" + buffer.length + \" bytes from \" + source);\n    });\n    \n    socket.send (buffer, 0, buffer.length, \"1.1.1.1\", function (error, bytes) {\n        if (error)\n            console.log (error.toString ());\n    });\n\n[homepage]: http://re-tool.org \"Homepage\"\n[nodejs]: http://nodejs.org \"Node.js\"\n[net-ping]: https://npmjs.org/package/net-ping \"net-ping\"\n[npm]: https://npmjs.org/ \"npm\"\n\n# Network Protocol Support\n\nThe raw sockets exposed by this module support IPv4 and IPv6.\n\nRaw sockets are created using the operating systems `socket()` function, and\nthe socket type `SOCK_RAW` specified.\n\n# Raw Socket Behaviour\n\nRaw sockets behave in different ways depending on operating system and\nversion, and may support different socket options.\n\nSome operating system versions may restrict the use of raw sockets to\nprivileged users.  If this is the case an exception will be thrown on socket\ncreation using a message similar to `Operation not permitted` (this message\nis likely to be different depending on operating system version).\n\nThe appropriate operating system documentation should be consulted to\nunderstand how raw sockets will behave before attempting to use this module.\n\n# Keeping The [Node.js][nodejs] Event Loop Alive\n\nThis module uses the `libuv` library to integrate into the [Node.js][nodejs]\nevent loop - this library is also used by [Node.js][nodejs].  An underlying\n `libuv` library `poll_handle_t` event watcher is used to monitor the\nunderlying operating system raw socket used by a socket object.\n\nAll the while a socket object exists, and the sockets `close()` method has not\nbeen called, the raw socket will keep the [Node.js][nodejs] event loop alive\nwhich will prevent a program from exiting.\n\nThis module exports four methods which a program can use to control this\nbehaviour.\n\nThe `pauseRecv()` and `pauseSend()` methods stop the underlying `poll_handle_t`\nevent watcher used by a socket from monitoring for readable and writeable\nevents.  While the `resumeRecv()` and `resumeSend()` methods start the\nunderlying `poll_handle_t` event watcher used by a socket allowing it to\nmonitor for readable and writeable events.\n\nEach socket object also exports the `recvPaused` and `sendPaused` boolean\nattributes to determine the state of the underlying `poll_handle_t` event\nwatcher used by a socket.\n\nSocket creation can be expensive on some platforms, and the above methods offer\nan alternative to closing and deleting a socket to prevent it from keeping the\n[Node.js][nodejs] event loop alive.\n\nThe [Node.js][nodejs] [net-ping][net-ping] module offers a concrete example\nof using these methods.  Since [Node.js][nodejs] offers no raw socket support\nthis module is used to implement ICMP echo (ping) support.  Once all ping\nrequests have been processed by the [net-ping][net-ping] module the\n`pauseRecv()` and `pauseSend()` methods are used to allow a program to exit if\nrequired.\n\nThe following example stops the underlying `poll_handle_t` event watcher used\nby a socket from generating writeable events, however since readable events\nwill still be watched for the program will not exit immediately:\n\n    if (! socket.recvPaused)\n        socket.pauseRecv ();\n\nThe following can the be used to resume readable events:\n\n    if (socket.recvPaused)\n        socket.resumeRecv ();\n\nThe following example stops the underlying `poll_handle_t` event watcher used\nby a socket from generating both readable and writeable events, if no other\nevent watchers have been setup (e.g. `setTimeout()`) the program will exit.\n\n    if (! socket.recvPaused)\n        socket.pauseRecv ();\n    if (! socket.sendPaused)\n        socket.pauseSend ();\n\nThe following can the be used to resume both readable and writeable events:\n\n    if (socket.recvPaused)\n        socket.resumeRecv ();\n    if (socket.sendPaused)\n        socket.resumeSend ();\n\nWhen data is sent using a sockets `send()` method the `resumeSend()` method\nwill be called if the sockets `sendPaused` attribute is `true`, however the\n`resumeRecv()` method will not be called regardless of whether the sockets\n`recvPaused` attribute is `true` or `false`.\n\n[nodejs]: http://nodejs.org \"Node.js\"\n[net-ping]: http://npmjs.org/package/net-ping \"net-ping\"\n\n# Constants\n\nThe following sections describe constants exported and used by this module.\n\n## raw.AddressFamily\n\nThis object contains constants which can be used for the `addressFamily`\noption to the `createSocket()` function exposed by this module.  This option\nspecifies the IP protocol version to use when creating the raw socket.\n\nThe following constants are defined in this object:\n\n * `IPv4` - IPv4 protocol\n * `IPv6` - IPv6 protocol\n\n## raw.Protocol\n\nThis object contains constants which can be used for the `protocol` option to\nthe `createSocket()` function exposed by this module.  This option specifies\nthe protocol number to place in the protocol field of IP headers generated by\nthe operating system.\n\nThe following constants are defined in this object:\n\n * `None` - protocol number 0\n * `ICMP` - protocol number 1\n * `TCP` - protocol number 6\n * `UDP` - protocol number 17\n * `ICMPv6` - protocol number 58\n\n## raw.SocketLevel\n\nThis object contains constants which can be used for the `level` parameter to\nthe `getOption()` and `setOption()` methods exposed by this module.\n\nThe following constants are defined in this object:\n\n * `SOL_SOCKET`\n * `IPPROTO_IP`\n * `IPPROTO_IPV6`\n\n## raw.SocketOption\n\nThis object contains constants which can be used for the `option` parameter to\nthe `getOption()` and `setOption()` methods exposed by this module.\n\nThe following constants are defined in this object:\n\n * `SO_RCVBUF`\n * `SO_RCVTIMEO`\n * `SO_SNDBUF`\n * `SO_SNDTIMEO`\n * `IP_HDRINCL`\n * `IP_OPTIONS`\n * `IP_TOS`\n * `IP_TTL`\n * `IPV6_TTL`\n * `IPV6_UNICAST_HOPS`\n * `IPV6_V6ONLY`\n\n*The `IPV6_TTL` socket option is not known to be defined by any operating\nsystem, it is provided in convenience to be synonymous with IPv4*\n\nFor Windows platforms the following constant is also defined:\n\n * `IPV6_HDRINCL`\n\n# Using This Module\n\nRaw sockets are represented by an instance of the `Socket` class.  This\nmodule exports the `createSocket()` function which is used to create\ninstances of the `Socket` class.\n\nThe module also exports a number of stubs which call through to a number of\nfunctions provided by the operating system, i.e. `htonl()`.\n\nThis module also exports a function to generate protocol checksums.\n\n## raw.createChecksum (bufferOrObject, [bufferOrObject, ...])\n\nThe `createChecksum()` function creates and returns a 16 bit one's complement\nof the one's complement sum for all the data specified in one or more\n[Node.js][nodejs] `Buffer` objects.  This is useful for creating checksums for\nprotocols such as IP, TCP, UDP and ICMP.\n\nThe `bufferOrObject` parameter can be one of two types.  The first is a\n[Node.js][nodejs] `Buffer` object.  In this case a checksum is calculated from\nall the data it contains.  The `bufferOrObject` parameter can also be an\nobject which must contain the following attributes:\n\n * `buffer` - A [Node.js][nodejs] `Buffer` object which contains data which\n   to generate a checksum for\n * `offset` - Skip this number of bytes from the beginning of `buffer`\n * `length` - Only generate a checksum for this number of bytes in `buffer`\n   from `offset`\n\nThe second parameter type provides control over how much of the data in a\n[Node.js][nodejs] `Buffer` object a checksum should be generated for.\n\nWhen more than one parameter is passed a single checksum is calculated as if\nthe data in in all parameters were in a single buffer.  This is useful for\nwhen calulating checksums for TCP and UDP for example - where a psuedo header\nmust be created and used for checksum calculation.\n\nIn this case two buffers can be passed, the first containing the psuedo header\nand the second containing the real TCP packet, and the offset and length\nparameters used to specify the bounds of the TCP packet payload.\n\nThe following example generates a checksum for a TCP packet and its psuedo\nheader:\n\n    var sum = raw.createChecksum (pseudo_header, {buffer: tcp_packet,\n            offset: 20, length: tcp_packet.length - 20});\n\nBoth buffers will be treated as one, i.e. as if the data at offset `20` in\n`tcp_packet` had followed all data in `pseudo_header` - as if they were one\nbuffer.\n\n## raw.writeChecksum (buffer, offset, checksum)\n\nThe `writeChecksum()` function writes a checksum created by the\n`raw.createChecksum()` function to the [Node.js][nodejs] `Buffer` object \n`buffer` at offsets `offset` and `offset` + 1.\n\nThe following example generates and writes a checksum at offset `2` in a\n[Node.js][nodejs] `Buffer` object:\n\n    raw.writeChecksum (buffer, 2, raw.createChecksum (buffer));\n\n## raw.htonl (uint32)\n\nThe `htonl()` function converts a 32 bit unsigned integer from host byte\norder to network byte order and returns the result.  This function is simply\na stub through to the operating systems `htonl()` function.\n\n## raw.htons (uint16)\n\nThe `htons()` function converts a 16 bit unsigned integer from host byte\norder to network byte order and returns the result.  This function is simply\na stub through to the operating systems `htons()` function.\n\n## raw.ntohl (uint32)\n\nThe `ntohl()` function converts a 32 bit unsigned integer from network byte\norder to host byte order and returns the result.  This function is simply\na stub through to the operating systems `ntohl()` function.\n\n## raw.ntohs (uint16)\n\nThe `ntohs()` function converts a 16 bit unsigned integer from network byte\norder to host byte order and returns the result.  This function is simply\na stub through to the operating systems `ntohs()` function.\n\n## raw.createSocket ([options])\n\nThe `createSocket()` function instantiates and returns an instance of the\n`Socket` class:\n\n    // Default options\n    var options = {\n        addressFamily: raw.AddressFamily.IPv4,\n        protocol: raw.Protocol.None,\n        bufferSize: 4096,\n        generateChecksums: false,\n        checksumOffset: 0\n    };\n    \n    var socket = raw.createSocket (options);\n\nThe optional `options` parameter is an object, and can contain the following\nitems:\n\n * `addressFamily` - Either the constant `raw.AddressFamily.IPv4` or the\n   constant `raw.AddressFamily.IPv6`, defaults to the constant\n   `raw.AddressFamily.IPv4`\n * `protocol` - Either one of the constants defined in the `raw.Protocol`\n   object or the protocol number to use for the socket, defaults to the\n   consant `raw.Protocol.None`\n * `bufferSize` - Size, in bytes, of the sockets internal receive buffer,\n   defaults to 4096\n * `generateChecksums` - Either `true` or `false` to enable or disable the\n   automatic checksum generation feature, defaults to `false`\n * `checksumOffset` - When `generateChecksums` is `true` specifies how many\n   bytes to index into the send buffer to write automatically generated\n   checksums, defaults to `0`\n\nAn exception will be thrown if the underlying raw socket could not be created.\nThe error will be an instance of the `Error` class.\n\nThe `protocol` parameter, or its default value of the constant\n`raw.Protocol.None`, will be specified in the protocol field of each IP\nheader.\n\n## socket.on (\"close\", callback)\n\nThe `close` event is emitted by the socket when the underlying raw socket\nis closed.\n\nNo arguments are passed to the callback.\n\nThe following example prints a message to the console when the socket is\nclosed:\n\n    socket.on (\"close\", function () {\n        console.log (\"socket closed\");\n    });\n\n## socket.on (\"error\", callback)\n\nThe `error` event is emitted by the socket when an error occurs sending or\nreceiving data.\n\nThe following arguments will be passed to the `callback` function:\n\n * `error` - An instance of the `Error` class, the exposed `message` attribute\n   will contain a detailed error message.\n\nThe following example prints a message to the console when an error occurs,\nafter which the socket is closed:\n\n    socket.on (\"error\", function (error) {\n        console.log (error.toString ());\n        socket.close ();\n    });\n\n## socket.on (\"message\", callback)\n\nThe `message` event is emitted by the socket when data has been received.\n\nThe following arguments will be passed to the `callback` function:\n\n * `buffer` - A [Node.js][nodejs] `Buffer` object containing the data\n   received, the buffer will be sized to fit the data received, that is the\n   `length` attribute of buffer will specify how many bytes were received\n * `address` - For IPv4 raw sockets the dotted quad formatted source IP\n   address of the message, e.g `192.168.1.254`, for IPv6 raw sockets the\n   compressed formatted source IP address of the message, e.g.\n   `fe80::a00:27ff:fe2a:3427`\n\nThe following example prints received messages in hexadecimal to the console:\n\n    socket.on (\"message\", function (buffer, address) {\n        console.log (\"received \" + buffer.length + \" bytes from \" + address\n                + \": \" + buffer.toString (\"hex\"));\n    });\n\n## socket.generateChecksums (generate, offset)\n\nThe `generateChecksums()` method is used to specify whether automatic checksum\ngeneration should be performed by the socket.\n\nThe `generate` parameter is either `true` or `false` to enable or disable the\nfeature.  The optional `offset` parameter specifies how many bytes to index\ninto the send buffer when writing the generated checksum to the send buffer.\n\nThe following example enables automatic checksum generation at offset 2\nresulting in checksums being written to byte 3 and 4 of the send buffer\n(offsets start from 0, meaning byte 1):\n\n    socket.generateChecksums (true, 2);\n\n## socket.getOption (level, option, buffer, length)\n\nThe `getOption()` method gets a socket option using the operating systems\n`getsockopt()` function.\n\nThe `level` parameter is one of the constants defined in the `raw.SocketLevel`\nobject.  The `option` parameter is one of the constants defined in the\n`raw.SocketOption` object.  The `buffer` parameter is a [Node.js][nodejs]\n`Buffer` object where the socket option value will be written.  The `length`\nparameter specifies the size of the `buffer` parameter.\n\nIf an error occurs an exception will be thrown, the exception will be an\ninstance of the `Error` class.\n\nThe number of bytes written into the `buffer` parameter is returned, and can\ndiffer from the amount of space available.\n\nThe following example retrieves the current value of `IP_TTL` socket option:\n\n    var level = raw.SocketLevel.IPPROTO_IP;\n    var option = raw.SocketOption.IP_TTL;\n    \n    # IP_TTL is a signed integer on some platforms so a 4 byte buffer is used\n    var buffer = new Buffer (4);\n    \n    var written = socket.getOption (level, option, buffer, buffer.length);\n    \n    console.log (buffer.toString (\"hex\"), 0, written);\n\n## socket.send (buffer, offset, length, address, beforeCallback, afterCallback)\n\nThe `send()` method sends data to a remote host.\n\nThe `buffer` parameter is a [Node.js][nodejs] `Buffer` object containing the\ndata to be sent.  The `length` parameter specifies how many bytes from\n`buffer`, beginning at offset `offset`, to send.  For IPv4 raw sockets the\n`address` parameter contains the dotted quad formatted IP address of the\nremote host to send the data to, e.g `192.168.1.254`, for IPv6 raw sockets the\n`address` parameter contains the compressed formatted IP address of the remote\nhost to send the data to, e.g. `fe80::a00:27ff:fe2a:3427`.  If provided the\noptional `beforeCallback` function is called right before the data is actually\nsent using the underlying raw socket, giving users the opportunity to perform\npre-send actions such as setting a socket option, e.g. the IP header TTL.  No\narguments are passed to the `beforeCallback` function.  The `afterCallback`\nfunction is called once the data has been sent.  The following arguments will\nbe passed to the `afterCallback` function:\n\n * `error` - Instance of the `Error` class, or `null` if no error occurred\n * `bytes` - Number of bytes sent\n\nThe following example sends a ICMP ping message to a remote host, before the\nrequest is actually sent the IP header TTL is modified, and modified again\nafter the data has been sent:\n\n    // ICMP echo (ping) request, checksum should be ok\n    var buffer = new Buffer ([\n            0x08, 0x00, 0x43, 0x52, 0x00, 0x01, 0x0a, 0x09,\n            0x61, 0x62, 0x63, 0x64, 0x65, 0x66, 0x67, 0x68,\n            0x69, 0x6a, 0x6b, 0x6c, 0x6d, 0x6e, 0x6f, 0x70,\n            0x71, 0x72, 0x73, 0x74, 0x75, 0x76, 0x77, 0x61,\n            0x62, 0x63, 0x64, 0x65, 0x66, 0x67, 0x68, 0x69]);\n\n    var socketLevel = raw.SocketLevel.IPPROTO_IP\n    var socketOption = raw.SocketOption.IP_TTL;\n\n    function beforeSend () {\n        socket.setOption (socketLevel, socketOption, 1);\n    }\n    \n    function afterSend (error, bytes) {\n        if (error)\n            console.log (error.toString ());\n        else\n            console.log (\"sent \" + bytes + \" bytes\");\n        \n        socket.setOption (socketLevel, socketOption, 1);\n    }\n\n    socket.send (buffer, 0, buffer.length, target, beforeSend, afterSend);\n\n## socket.setOption (level, option, buffer, length)\n\nThe `setOption()` method sets a socket option using the operating systems\n`setsockopt()` function.\n\nThe `level` parameter is one of the constants defined in the `raw.SocketLevel`\nobject.  The `option` parameter is one of the constants defined in the\n`raw.SocketOption` object.  The `buffer` parameter is a [Node.js][nodejs]\n`Buffer` object where the socket option value is specified.  The `length`\nparameter specifies how much space the option value occupies in the `buffer`\nparameter.\n\nIf an error occurs an exception will be thrown, the exception will be an\ninstance of the `Error` class.\n\nThe following example sets the value of `IP_TTL` socket option to `1`:\n\n    var level = raw.SocketLevel.IPPROTO_IP;\n    var option = raw.SocketOption.IP_TTL;\n    \n    # IP_TTL is a signed integer on some platforms so a 4 byte buffer is used,\n    # x86 computers use little-endian format so specify bytes reverse order\n    var buffer = new Buffer ([0x01, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00]);\n    \n    socket.setOption (level, option, buffer, buffer.length);\n\nTo avoid dealing with endianess the `setOption()` method supports a three\nargument form which can be used for socket options requiring a 32bit unsigned\ninteger value (for example the `IP_TTL` socket option used in the previous\nexample).  Its signature is as follows:\n\n    socket.setOption (level, option, value)\n\nThe previous example can be re-written to use this form:\n\n    var level = raw.SocketLevel.IPPROTO_IP;\n    var option = raw.SocketOption.IP_TTL;\n\n    socket.setOption (level, option, 1);\n\n# Example Programs\n\nExample programs are included under the modules `example` directory.\n\n# Bugs & Known Issues\n\nNone, yet!\n\nBug reports should be sent to <stephen.vickers.sv@gmail.com>.\n\n# Changes\n\n## Version 1.0.0 -
